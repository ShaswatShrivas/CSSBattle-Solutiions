1.In this puzzle we have to create three semicircles using CSS who are having a differnet border width as compared to their bottom border.
2. I was able to solve this puzzle to some extent by using the border-radius property and setting the border width to 20px.But I am not able to get close to 90% match.As I am not able to set the border width to different width as compared to their bottom border.
3. If you have any other approach to solve this puzzle then please let me know.ðŸ™Œ
